# circleci-orb-user-test

A sandbox to try out various CircleCI concepts:

- Authing to Docker Hub for executor setup
- Authing to Docker Hub for non-executor Docker image pulls (ex. backing services)
- Authing to Docker Hub for pulling base image for building an app
- Using the Pub/Sub emulator from a backing service non-executor Docker container
